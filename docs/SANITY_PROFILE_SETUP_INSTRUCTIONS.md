**Template A - Leadership Philosophy:**
```
I don't just lead, I build from the ground up, every single day. I'm a founder who's hands-on across every department, from Product to Technology, from Marketing to Sales, from Design to Analytics, from Research to Finance, from HR to Investor Relations. I've worked deep in the trenches and high at the strategy table, ensuring that every line of code, every campaign, every pitch, and every process aligns with the bigger vision. I collaborate, inspire, and architect a culture where every single member feels like a founder.

My leadership style is simple: be the chill founder who builds entrepreneurs. I empower my team to take ownership, to challenge conventions, and to bring the absolute best version of themselves to the table. I believe in building people, not just products. By fostering their strengths and championing their ideas, we don't just build a company, we build dreams, legacies, and the future of gaming itself.
