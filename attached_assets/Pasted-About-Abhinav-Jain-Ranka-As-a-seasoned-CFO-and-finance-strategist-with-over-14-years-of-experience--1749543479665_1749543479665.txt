About Abhinav Jain Ranka
As a seasoned CFO and finance strategist with over 14 years of experience, I’ve helped scale some of India’s most recognized companies, including PharmEasy, where I led multi-billion-dollar fundraising rounds, IPO preparation, and large-scale M&A deals. I specialize in aligning financial leadership with high-growth business goals—spanning IPO readiness, due diligence, fundraising, business restructuring, and cross-border acquisitions.
My leadership spans diverse industries from healthcare and pharma to tech, with extensive hands-on experience across Indian GAAP, IFRS, and US GAAP. I’ve worked with leading financial systems like SAP, D365, and Hyperion, and have built scalable finance automation solutions. I’m passionate about mentoring finance professionals and startup founders looking to navigate complex growth, funding, or exit scenarios.
