Today, over a billion Indians practicing different religions and speaking different local languages coexist in harmony in the largest democracy. A population this diverse necessitates that laws of domestic relations should be in accordance with their faiths and appropriate to everyone.
* 		
* 		The IITG Model United Nations proudly presents the agenda for Lok Sabha, Redefining Family Laws: Dissecting the Matrimonial Laws in India. It emphasizes taboo subjects such as marital rape and same-sex marriage and concentrates on legal loopholes that deal with legal concerns that arise in families or other personal relationships.
* 		
* 		 Does custom override statutory family laws? Is a foreign divorce decree recognized by the Indian courts? Are civil partnerships legal in India? Can a single man have his own child through surrogacy? This February, answer all these questions as IITGMUN plans to analyze family laws and pass legislation to address their flaws.
