        * 		I worked as a 3D Graphic Design Intern at Gamers Tag for two months. During my time there, I saw that Joshua is a great leader. He was one of the very few people with whom I have directly interacted and wondered how they manage the time to do all that they do. Throughout my internship period he was in constant contact with me, guiding me to better myself as a designer. More than the advices he gave me , it was how he communicated those advices to me that was more impactful. 
        * 		
        * 		Joshua is really chill, easy to talk to and is always open to hearing what I had to say. The working environment was super calm and composed under him yet he was able to make sure the work was done on time. He is one of the finest examples of a leader I have personally known in my life and I am hoping that he will reach great heights. I recommend Joshua Kanatt as a CEO and mentor. He's a great leader who cares about his team, knows about the industry in abundance and is always ready to help you grow.
