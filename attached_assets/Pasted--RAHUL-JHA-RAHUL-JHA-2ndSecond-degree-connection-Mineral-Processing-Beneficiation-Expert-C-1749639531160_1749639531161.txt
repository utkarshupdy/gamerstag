        * 		Joshua is really chill, easy to talk to and is always open to hearing what I had to say. The working environment was super calm and composed under him yet he was able to make sure the work was done on time. He is one of the finest examples of a leader I have personally known in my life and I am hoping that he will reach great heights. I recommend Joshua Kanatt as a CEO and mentor. He's a great leader who cares about his team, knows about the industry in abundance and is always ready to help you grow.
