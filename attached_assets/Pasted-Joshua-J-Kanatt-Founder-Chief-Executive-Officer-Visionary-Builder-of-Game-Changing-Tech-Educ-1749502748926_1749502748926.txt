What i do ?

I donâ€™t just lead, I build from the ground up, every single day.

Iâ€™m a founder whoâ€™s hands-on across every department, from Product to Technology, from Marketing to Sales, from Design to Analytics, from Research to Finance, from HR to Investor Relations. Iâ€™ve worked deep in the trenches and high at the strategy table, ensuring that every line of code, every campaign, every pitch, and every process aligns with the bigger vision. I collaborate, inspire, and architect a culture where every single member feels like a founder.

My leadership style is simple: be the chill founder who builds entrepreneurs. I empower my team to take ownership, to challenge conventions, and to bring the absolute best version of themselves to the table. I believe in building people, not just products. By fostering their strengths and championing their ideas, we don't just build a company, we build dreams, legacies, and the future of gaming itself.
