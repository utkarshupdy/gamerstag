I have known Abhinav for over 4 years now. He had worked with me at Binani Industries Limited, I was amazed by this unique person. He is so different from the usual financial analyst material that I have seen. A simple, down to earth, people's man who is an all rounder. He is a great Finance expert and having financial acumen like a hawk. What makes him stand out is his innovative mind, connecting with people, leading a happy and effective team. All the best Abhinav, you deserve it.
